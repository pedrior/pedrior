# Hi there, I'm Pedro ðŸ‘‹

A .NET developer and CS student based in Brazil.

Lately, I've been focusing on backend API development, emphasizing design and architectural patterns. 
I'm hugely interested in best programming practices and I try to write good and efficient code whenever possible.
I'm also interested in desktop development, primarily using WPF.
